---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Author:** Sefer Adiyaman  
**Project period:** July 8 – July 22, 2025  
**Tools used:** Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `shap`), Excel, Tableau, Jupyter Notebook

This project focuses on evaluating marketing campaign performance using modern data analysis techniques. The approach combines predictive modeling, SHAP-based model interpretation, and effective data visualization to support evidence-based decisions.

### Main Objectives:
1. **Construction of a data-driven, synthetic Performance Score**  
   → A unified score that combines multiple KPIs (e.g., CTR, CR, CPA) into a single, interpretable metric scaled from 0 to 100 using SHAP-based feature weighting.

2. **Development of a user-friendly dashboard for supporting campaign management decisions**  
   → An interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes campaign scores, KPI breakdowns, and percentile rankings to help executives quickly identify strengths and weaknesses.
